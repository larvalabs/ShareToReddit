ShareToReddit
=============

An iOS UIActivity for posting an image to Reddit. See the demo app for basic usage.

To use this you need an Imgur API key. Go to [api.imgur.com](http://api.imgur.com) and look for the 'register' link. Try and build the example and you should get an error telling you where to put the client id.

Or if you just want to test-drive the UI, leave garbage in for the Imgur the client-ID and it'll work as far as submitting the post.

Right now this is limited to what I needed it to do:
 - iOS7 only
 - iPad only
 - Shares a single UIImage

None of the above should be particularly hard to fix.

Features:

 - Reddit credentials are stored in the keychain as raw username/passwords (ugh, sorry), and it'll remember multiple at a time for fast switching between alts.
 - Captchas handled for low-karma posters
 - You can supply a list of suggested subreddits to post to, plus the UI will present the most recently used ones.

If you want to ship this in a commercial app, you also need to sign up with [Mashape](https://www.mashape.com/imgur/apiv3), who meter Imgur's API usage.
Their free plan allows 1250 free uploads per day, and after that it's 1Â¢ per 10 uploads.

You'll also need permission from licensing@reddit.com to use the Reddit logo, or else you can replace reddit7.png with something else.

Questions / suggestions welcome, but having gotten this to where I need it for [my app](http://chunkyreader.com) it's not a super high-priority project for me.
